## Welcome to Pixel & Processor! ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, and a warm welcome to my new little corner of the internet â€“ **Pixel & Processor**! I'm Abhay Raj, a B.Tech Information Technology student with a deep-seated passion for all things tech. I'm incredibly excited to finally launch this blog as a space to document my journey, share my learnings, and connect with like-minded individuals.

For a while now, I've been immersed in the worlds of full-stack web development and game creation, while also nurturing a keen interest in the hardware that makes it all possible, and the Linux environments I love to tinker in. This blog is an attempt to bring those threads together.

### The "Pixel" Side: Crafting Digital Experiences

The "Pixel" in the name represents my love for the creative and constructive side of software development. This is where I delve into:

*   **Full-Stack Web Development:** I truly enjoy building user-friendly and efficient web applications. My toolkit often includes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Next.js for modern web experiences, and exploring cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. From designing a UI with TailwindCSS or Material-UI to architecting the backend logic and database interactions, the entire process captivates me. You might have seen my work on projects like my [Task Management Web App](YOUR_PROJECT_LINK_HERE_IF_APPLICABLE) or the [Finalbenchmark Web Platform](YOUR_PROJECT_LINK_HERE_IF_APPLICABLE).
*   **Game Development:** There's something uniquely magical about bringing interactive worlds to life. I primarily use Unity and C# to develop games, often using Blender for creating 3D assets. The challenge of crafting engaging gameplay mechanics, designing levels, and seeing an idea evolve into an experience is incredibly rewarding. I'm currently working on an RPG called "Story of Xirsia" and have previously released "Finalbenchmark," a mobile app that saw over 15,000 downloads!

### The "Processor" Side: Understanding the Foundations

And then there's the "Processor" â€“ my fascination with the underlying hardware, systems, and the raw power that enables all this digital magic:

*   **Tech Hardware Enthusiasm:** I'm always keen to learn about the latest CPUs, GPUs, and smartphone SoCs. Understanding how these components perform, their architecture, and how they impact software is something I find genuinely exciting. This curiosity even led me to develop the [Finalbenchmark mobile app](YOUR_APP_LINK_HERE_IF_APPLICABLE) for benchmarking smartphone processors.
*   **Linux & Open Source:** As a dedicated Arch Linux power user, I deeply appreciate the control, flexibility, and philosophy of open-source software. Tinkering with my setup, exploring different tools, trying to run Linux on Android â€“ it's all part of the fun and learning for me.

### What to Expect from This Blog?

So, why "Pixel & Processor"? Because I believe these two aspects are deeply intertwined. Great software often benefits from an understanding of the hardware it runs on, and a passion for technology can fuel creative development.

Through this blog, I plan to share:

*   **Project Devlogs:** Updates and insights from my ongoing web and game development projects.
*   **Tutorials & How-Tos:** Practical guides on specific technologies, coding techniques, or Linux setups that I find useful.
*   **Tech Thoughts:** My take on new hardware releases, software trends, or interesting developments in the tech world.
*   **Learnings & Challenges:** The honest ups and downs of being a developer and a continuous learner.

I'm still learning and growing every day, and I hope this blog can be a place where we can learn together. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a fellow student, a hardware geek, or just curious about tech, I hope you find something interesting here.
